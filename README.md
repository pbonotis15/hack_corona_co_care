## Overview

CoCare is a Flutter-based mobile application developed to support vulnerable groups, including elderly individuals and those with chronic conditions, by connecting them with volunteers for assistance during challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

CoCare was part of a larger project created during a hackathon, designed with the potential to integrate with a back-end server for more comprehensive functionality, including data management and the ability to generate statistical insights. However, what you see here is the prototype developed during the hackathon. It is solely a front-end application, showcasing the envisioned user interface and basic interaction flow. Please note that this prototype does not have full functionality and is not connected to any back-end services.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Separate registration and login for citizens and volunteers.
- **Volunteer Support**: Volunteers can offer help to those in need by delivering medicines, groceries, etc.
- **Information Sharing**: The app provides relevant information and updates about the pandemic.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for both volunteers and citizens.
